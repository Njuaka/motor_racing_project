# Real-World Data Engineering Solution on Azure

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end data engineering solution on Azure. It leverages Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Gen2, Azure Data Factory, Delta Lake, and Power BI to build a robust Lakehouse architecture. The solution demonstrates real-world data ingestion, transformation, and visualization processes while incorporating advanced data governance through Unity Catalog.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to:
- **Ingest Data:** Load data from CSV and JSON files into Azure Data Lake Gen2.
- **Transform Data:** Utilize PySpark and Spark SQL for data cleansing, joining, aggregations, and window functions.
- **Implement Lakehouse Architecture:** Convert data to Parquet and Delta Lake formats, leveraging incremental load patterns and Delta Lake functionalities like time travel, merge, and vacuum.
- **Orchestrate ETL Pipelines:** Use Azure Data Factory to manage, schedule, and monitor the execution of Databricks notebooks.
- **Visualize Data:** Connect to Databricks tables from Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
- **Ensure Data Governance:** Utilize Unity Catalog to provide data discovery, audit, lineage, and access control.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Databricks:** For processing and transforming data using Spark.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2:** For scalable and secure data storage.
- **Azure Data Factory:** For building, scheduling, and monitoring ETL pipelines.
- **Delta Lake:** To implement Lakehouse architecture and handle incremental loads.
- **Power BI:** For creating dynamic dashboards and data visualizations.
- **Unity Catalog:** For data governance and management.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for real-world data volumes using cloud-native services.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Robust orchestration of data ingestion, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Incremental & Full Refresh Loads:** Implemented using partitioning and Delta Lake features.
- **Data Governance:** Managed via Unity Catalog for secure and compliant data handling.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Real-time insights through Power BI dashboards.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Integration with Azure Key Vault for secure storage credentials.

## Project Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Data is ingested from CSV and JSON files.
   - Raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2.
   
2. **Data Processing & Transformation:**
   - Azure Databricks notebooks process the data using PySpark and Spark SQL.
   - Data is transformed and stored in Delta Lake format, with support for both full refresh and incremental loads.
   
3. **Pipeline Orchestration:**
   - Azure Data Factory triggers and manages the execution of Databricks notebooks.
   - Robust error handling and dependencies are implemented to handle unexpected scenarios.
   
4. **Data Governance & Security:**
   - Unity Catalog is used to manage metadata, enforce data access controls, and ensure data lineage.
   - Azure Key Vault provides secure access to sensitive configuration information.
   
5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Power BI connects to the transformed datasets in Databricks, providing interactive dashboards and reports.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription:** Active subscription to deploy and test the solution.
- **Basic Programming Skills:** Familiarity with Python and SQL.
- **Cloud Fundamentals:** Basic understanding of cloud concepts is beneficial.
